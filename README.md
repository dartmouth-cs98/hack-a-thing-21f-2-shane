# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

A chat client using the technology socket.io. I followed a couple tutorials which are acknowledged later. I wanted to use this technology because it ties in really well with the goals of Warbler and created a kahot-like game for in-class engagement.

Along with this "thing" that I created, I spent a lot of time in Unity, playing around with my hack-a-thing-1 and tried to make a game of "tag" that was serviceable and connectable on the internet but that was taking too much time and I pivoted away to just learn about socket.io! I also tried to create a mini version of kahoot where the server would register what each user input and then output the scores, but I had some server issues with permissions and CORS policy that I could not resolve so I did not include that code in this submission as it did not work.

I recognize that the actual code that is included in this submission did not take that much time, but coupled with the efforts that I described above, this assignment took me slightly over 10 hours even though my output is not super indicative of that.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

I worked alone

## What you learned

* Building and shipping a unity project and having it be multiplayer compatible is complicated but Unity provides an awesome amount of resources to learn and push it forward
* When building servers, and following tutorials to do so, it is really important to understand CORS policy and how it works to troubleshoot socket connection errors quickly, I spent a couple of hours trying to resolve CORS issues to no avail.
* I learned that it will definitely be possible to build what we plan for Warbler and the in-class engagement component, I am unbelievably excited to get started!
